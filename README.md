# Tip Calculator

This is an iPhone application that calculates gratuity.  The application has various functionalities that allow users to select a desired percentage and split totals.  When the calculate button is pressed, it segues into the second screen where the user can see the calculated results.  If there is a rounding error (for instance, $7 bill split by three people with no tip), the second screen shows a message prompting the user to add a cent.
